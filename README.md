# Spooky Halloween Hackpack Code

This code is the finalized Halloween Hackpack code for the littleBits Arduino. It shows a spooky ghost and bat based on SMS input. The completed code even has blinking eyes that are not present in the blog post version!

For details on how the hardware and Arduino IDE work, check out Ricky Robinett's [How to Build Your Own Hackpack](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/05/how-to-build-your-own-hackpack.html). More information about how to program LEDs can be found in [Light Up Your Hackpack With the Adafruit NeoMatrix Library](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/05/light-up-your-hackpack-with-the-adafruit-neomatrix-library.html). 

Happy hacking!
